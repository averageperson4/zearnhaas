This a recreation of now defunct 'billybobgames.github.io.' I will maintain it specifically to work at this school as the year goes on. If someone charged you to use this site, you are an idiot and got scammed. If you are playing games on your computer at lunch, go outside and socialize.

To do:
-download game preview image files to server for less load and more reliability
-remove the bypass goguardian option once goguardian has been bypassed
-switch which tab is redirected and which is opened for the goguardian bypass
-fix the issue where game preview images are cropped on some devices
