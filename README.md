# BillybobGames Revival

This is a recreation of the now-defunct **billybobgames.github.io**.  
It’s maintained specifically to function reliably at my school throughout the school year.

## ✅ Project Goals

- 🖼️ **Improve Performance:**  
  Download all game preview image files to the server for faster load times and improved reliability.

- 🌐 **Fully Functional Proxy:**  
  Make the smart proxy site actually work instead of just being a ui.

  For telling me this was a terrible idea and I would get suspended. (Thanks for the motivation 💀)
