This a recreation of now defunct 'billybobgames.github.io.' I will maintain it specifically to work at this school as the year goes on.



To do:
-download game preview image files to server for less load and more reliability



-make the smart proxy site actually functional



Credits:
monkeygg2 for inspiring the stlying of the site, as well as giving me the idea to make the bypass


my dad for teaching me a bit about html


chatgpt for basically making the entire backend and teaching me alot about site design
