This a recreation of now defunct 'billybobgames.github.io.' I will maintain it specifically to work at this school as the year goes on. If someone charged you to use this site, you are an idiot and got scammed. If you are playing games on your computer at lunch, go outside and socialize.

To do:
-download game preview image files to server for less load and more reliability



-fix the issue where game preview images are cropped on some devices


-add a fancy reactive backround with a toggle for low end devices
