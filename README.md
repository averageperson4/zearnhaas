# BillybobGames Revival

This is a recreation of the now-defunct **billybobgames.github.io**.  
It’s maintained specifically to function reliably at my school throughout the school year.

## ✅ Project Goals

- 🌐 **Fully Functional Proxy:**  
  Make a smart proxy site that automatically finds a good proxy for the user. We would host our own proxies, and if it couldnt connect to one of ours, it would try pinging a large list of third party proxies that is constantly being maintained. The user would never have to try multiple proxies, as the system would do everything automatically.
