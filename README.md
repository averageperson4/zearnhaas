# BillybobGames Revival

This is a recreation of the now-defunct **billybobgames.github.io**.  
It’s maintained specifically to function reliably at my school throughout the school year.

## ✅ Project Goals

- 🖼️ **Improve Performance:**  
  Download all game preview image files to the server for faster load times and improved reliability.

- 🌐 **Fully Functional Proxy:**  
  Make the smart proxy site work consistently and effectively, including bypass capabilities.

## 🙏 Credits

- **MonkeyGG2**  
  For inspiring the styling of the site and giving me the idea for the bypass system.

- **My Dad**  
  For teaching me some basics about HTML and web development.

- **ChatGPT**  
  For helping write most of the backend and teaching me a lot about site structure, design, and functionality.

- **My Gramma**  
  For telling me this was a terrible idea and I would get suspended. (Thanks for the motivation 💀)
